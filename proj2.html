</div><p>The objective of this project is to practice and assess your
understanding of logic programming and Prolog. You will write code to
solve fillin crossword puzzles.</p><!--TOC section id="sec1" Fillin Puzzles-->
<h2 id="sec1" class="section">Fillin Puzzles</h2><!--SEC END --><p>A fillin puzzle (sometimes called a fill-it-in) is like a crossword
puzzle, except that instead of being given obscure clues telling which
words go where, you are given a list of all the words to place in the
puzzle, but not told where they go.</p><p>The puzzle consists of a grid of squares, most of which are empty,
into which letters or digits are to be written, but some of which are filled in
solid, and are not to be written in. You are also given a list of
words or multi-digit numbers to place in the puzzle. Henceforth we
shall discuss the puzzles in terms of words and letters, but keep in
mind that they can be numbers and digits, too.
You must place each word in the word
list exactly once in the puzzle, either left-to-right or
top-to-bottom, filling a maximal sequence of empty squares. Also,
every maximal sequence of non-solid squares that is more than one
square long must have
one word from the word list written in it. Many words cross one
another, so many of the letters in a horizontal word will also be a
letter in a vertical word. For a properly constructed fillin puzzle,
there will be only one way to fill in the words (in some cases, the
puzzle is symmetrical around a diagonal axis, in which case there will
be two symmetrical solutions).</p><p>Here is an example 7 by 7 fillin puzzle, together with its solution,
taken from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fill-In_(puzzle)">Wikipedia page for fillin puzzles</a>. In this example, one word is
already written into the puzzle, but this is not required.</p><div class="center">

<h2 id="sec2" class="section">The Program</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
You will write Prolog code to solve fillin puzzles. Your main
predicate should be written in the file <span style="font-family:monospace">proj2.pl</span>, but you may
submit other prolog files if you like. If you do use multiple files,
make sure <span style="font-family:monospace">proj2.pl</span> loads the other files.</p><p>Your program should supply a predicate
<span style="font-family:monospace">main(</span><span style="font-style:italic">PuzzleFile, WordlistFile, SolutionFile</span><span style="font-family:monospace">)</span>
that reads
in the puzzle file whose name is <span style="font-style:italic">PuzzleFile</span> and the word list
file whose name is <span style="font-style:italic">WordlistFile</span>, solve the puzzle, and print
out the result to the file <span style="font-style:italic">SolutionFile</span>.</p><p>The puzzle file will contain a number of lines each
with the same number of characters, to form a rectangle. The
characters in this file should all be either an underline character
(<code>_</code>) indicating a fill-able square, a hash character (<code>#</code>)
indicating a solid, non-fill-able square, or a letter or digit, indicating a
pre-filled square.
The output <span style="font-style:italic">SolutionFile</span> must have the same format (except
that it should be filled, so it should not contain underlines).
The word list file is simply a text file with one word per line.</p><p>You will be provided with code to read in these files
and to print out the result in the form of a file
<span style="font-family:monospace">proj2_starter.pl</span>.
You may use this code, modify it as you like, or ignore it, but you
must provide the predicate
<span style="font-family:monospace">main(</span><span style="font-style:italic">PuzzleFile, WordlistFile, SolutionFile</span><span style="font-family:monospace">)</span>,
and your code must handle input files, and produce an output file, in
the specified format.
The starter file gives a trivial definition of the predicate
<span style="font-family:monospace">solve_puzzle</span>/3; you need only give a working definition of
this predicate, and of course properly
<span style="font-style:italic">document the predicates you are given</span> as well as
the predicates you write.
You should begin by renaming the starter file to <span style="font-family:monospace">proj2.pl</span>.</p><!--TOC section id="sec3" Assessment-->
<h2 id="sec3" class="section">Assessment</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Your project will be assessed on the following criteria:</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">30%</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Quality of your code and documentation;
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">30%</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> The ability of your program to correctly solve fill-in

puzzles (up to 32 by 20) that do require search.
</dd></dl><p>Note that timeouts will be imposed on all tests. You will have at least 20
seconds to solve each puzzle, regardless of difficulty.
Executions taking longer than that will be unceremoniously terminated,
leading to that test being assessed as failing. Twenty seconds should be
ample with careful implementation.</p><p>See the Project Coding Guidelines on the LMS for detailed suggestions
for coding style.
These guidelines will form the basis of the quality
assessment of your code and documentation.
Be sure to document the predicates you take from the starter file you
are given, too.</p><!--TOC section id="sec4" Submission-->
<h2 id="sec4" class="section">Submission</h2><!--SEC END --><p>The project submission deadline is Wednesday, 10 October 2018, 5:00PM.
You must submit your project from one of the Linux servers
<span style="font-family:monospace">dimefox.eng.unimelb.edu.au</span> or
<span style="font-family:monospace">nutmeg.eng.unimelb.edu.au</span>.
Note that this host is not
directly accessible from outside the university campus, so if you wish
to submit from home, you must use the university&#X2019;s VPN;
see the LMS Resources page for guidance.
Make sure the version of your program source files
you wish to submit is on the server, <span style="font-family:monospace">cd</span> to the directory
holding your source code and issue the command:
</p><pre>
    submit COMP30020 proj2 proj2.pl
</pre><p>
If your code spans multiple source files, add the extra ones to the
end of that command line.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Important:</span> you must wait a minute (more if the
servers are busy) and do:
</p><pre>
    verify COMP30020 proj2 | less
</pre><p>
This
will show you the test results from your submission, as well as the
file(s) you submitted. If the test results show any problems, correct
them and submit again. You may submit as often as you like; only your
final submission will be assessed.</p><p>If your program
compiles and runs properly, you should see the line &#X201C;<span style="font-family:monospace">Running
tests</span>&#X201D;, followed by several test runs.
If you do not see this, then your
program did not work correctly.
The version of SWI Prolog installed on the servers is older than you
probably have on your own computer or the lab computers, so you should
be sure to test your code on the servers.
Do not just assume it will run correctly.</p><p>If you wish to (re-)submit after the project deadline, you may do so
by adding &#X201C;<span style="font-family:monospace">.late</span>&#X201D; to the end of the project name
(<em>i.e.,</em> <span style="font-family:monospace">proj2.late</span>) in the <span style="font-family:monospace">submit</span> and
<span style="font-family:monospace">verify</span> commands. But note that a penalty, described below,
will apply to late submissions, so you should weigh the points you
will lose for a late submission against the points you expect to gain
by revising your program and submitting again.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">It is your responsibility to verify your submission.</span></p><p>Windows users should see the LMS Resources list for instructions for
downloading the (free) Putty and Winscp programs to allow you to use
and copy files to the department servers from windows computers. Mac
OS X and Linux users can use the <span style="font-family:monospace">ssh</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">scp</span>, and <span style="font-family:monospace">sftp</span>
programs that come with your operating system.</p><!--TOC subsection id="sec5" Late Penalties-->
<h3 id="sec5" class="subsection">Late Penalties</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
Late submissions will incur a penalty of 0.5% per hour late,
including evening and weekend hours. This means that a perfect
project that is much more than 4 days late will receive less than half
the marks for the project. If you have a
medical or similar compelling reason for being late, you should contact 
the lecturer
as early as possible to ask for an extension
(preferably before the due date).</p><!--TOC section id="sec6" Hints-->
<h2 id="sec6" class="section">Hints</h2><!--SEC END --><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
The basic strategy for solving these puzzles is to select a
&#X201C;slot&#X201D; (<em>i.e.</em>, a maximal horizontal or vertical sequence of
fill-able and pre-filled squares), and a word of the same length from
the word list, fill the word into the slot in the puzzle, and remove
the word from the word list. It is important that the word selected
should agree with any letters that are already filled into the slot.
Repeat this process until the puzzle is completely solved and the
word list is empty.</li><li class="li-enumerate">To avoid writing much code to handle filling slots vertically,
you can just transpose the puzzle, use operations to handle
horizontal puzzle slots, and then transpose the puzzle back.
It is easier to detect and handle horizontal slots than vertical
ones.<p>The SWI Prolog library provides two different, incompatible
<span style="font-family:monospace">transpose</span>/2 predicates, and unfortunately autoloads the
wrong one by default. If you wish to use the correct one, you
should put the line
</p><pre class="verbatim">        :- ensure_loaded(library(clpfd)).
</pre><p>
in your source file. This defines the predicate
<span style="font-family:monospace">transpose(</span><span style="font-style:italic">Matrix0, Matrix</span><span style="font-family:monospace">)</span> that holds
when <span style="font-style:italic">Matrix0</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Matrix</span> are lists of lists, and
the &#X201C;columns&#X201D; of each are the &#X201C;rows&#X201D; of the other.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate"><a id="logicvar"></a>
One of Prolog&#X2019;s features, known as the &#X201C;logical variable&#X201D; can
make this job easier.
You can construct a list of &#X201C;slots&#X201D; where each slot is a list of
Prolog variables representing one square in the puzzle.
If you make sure that the same variable is used for the same square,
whether it appears in a vertical or horizontal slot, then Prolog
will ensure that the letter placed in the box for a horizontal word
is the same as for an intersecting vertical word.<p>For example, suppose you have a 3&#XD7;3 puzzle with the four corners
filled in solid. This would be represented as a file with these
lines:
</p><div class="center">
<pre class="verbatim">                                #_#
                                ___
                                #_#
</pre>
</div><p>
The slots in this puzzle could be represented as
<span style="font-family:monospace">[[A,B,C], [X,B,Z]]</span>, in which case the filled-in puzzle will
be <code>Filled = [['#',X,'#'], [A,B,C], ['#',Z,'#']]</code>.
Then unifying <span style="font-family:monospace">[X,B,Z]</span> with <span style="font-family:monospace">[c,a,t]</span> will
bind <span style="font-family:monospace">B</span> to <span style="font-family:monospace">a</span> in both lists, ensuring that
the first list is only unified with a word that has an <span style="font-family:monospace">a</span>
as second letter.
Note that after the second list is unified with
<span style="font-family:monospace">[c,a,t]</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">Filled</span> will become
<code>[['#',c,'#'], [A,a,C], ['#',t,'#']]</code>.
Once the first list is unified, binding <span style="font-family:monospace">A</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">C</span>,
this will be the final solved puzzle.</p><p>With this approach, the list of slots is simply a permutation of the
list of words.
For small puzzles, it is sufficient to backtrack over permutations
of the wordlist until it can be unified with the slot list.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate">As an alternative to Hint&#XA0;<a href="#logicvar">3</a>, you may instead approach
the problem by repeatedly transforming the puzzle by filling in
slots in the puzzle.
With this approach, the 3&#XD7;3 puzzle discussed above would be
represented as
<div class="center">
<code>[['#','_','#'], ['_','_','_'], ['#','_','#']]</code>
</div>
Filling in &#X201C;cat&#X201D; in the vertical slot would leave:
<div class="center">
<code>[['#',c,'#'], ['_',a,'_'], ['#',t,'#']]</code>
</div>
(again, it is easiest to work with horizontal slots; a vertical slot
can be handled by transposing the puzzle, handling a horizontal
slot, and then transposing again).
As words are filled in, some of the letters of some slots will be
filled in.
Care must be taken when filling partially-filled slots to ensure the
word being placed matches the letters already placed in that slot.
Care must also be taken that a slot that has had all its letters
filled by filling perpendicular words is in fact a word, and that
word is removed from the word list.<p>This approach is simpler to understand than that of
Hint&#XA0;<a href="#logicvar">3</a>, but requires considerably more code, and more work.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate"><a id="fastfail"></a>
The number of permutations of a list of length <span style="font-style:italic">n</span> is <span style="font-style:italic">n</span>!.
Even a 7&#XD7;7 puzzle may have 18 words, which has
18! &gt; 10<sup>15</sup> permutations.
Careful use of Prolog can substantially reduce this search space
through the use of fast failure.
That is, as each word is selected for its slot, it should be unified
immediately with the slot.
If this fails, then all further permutations involving that word in
that slot can be discarded (Prolog will automatically do that).</li><li class="li-enumerate">Hint&#XA0;<a href="#fastfail">5</a> will allow medium-size puzzles to be solved.
For larger puzzles, the power of the factorial is too great.
To solve those, it is necessary to avoid more of the search space.
This can be done by carefully choosing the order in which to place
words in slots.
For example, if there is only one 6-letter word, then place that
first.
Once that word is placed, some letters in others words will
be filled in; perhaps one of them will have only one matching word,
and so on.
Each time a word is to be placed, you should count the number of
words that match each slot, and select (one of) the slot(s) with the
fewest matching words to fill.
This minimises the search space.</li><li class="li-enumerate"><a id="no-search"></a>
For some puzzles, as they are being filled in, there is always
at least one slot that has only one word that can possibly fit.
These puzzles are easier to solve, because no search is actually
required. 30% of the test cases will be like this.</li></ol><!--TOC section id="sec7" Note Well:-->
